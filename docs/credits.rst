About the oTherm Project
------------------------
The oTherm project was initiated as part of discussions in the Renewable Thermal
Alliance (RTA) and initiated with an RTA Innovation Grant to the University of New
Hampshire (UNH) to begin work on data dictionaries. Subsequently, UNH partnered with
the New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and the Yale Center
for Business and the Environment to secure a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy,
Office of State Energy Programs(DE-EE0008619 ) to build a functional prototype. The
UNH Interoperability Lab has been instrumental in the development work throughout the
process.
